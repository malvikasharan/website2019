He his particularly interested in the history of \"citizen science\" and the transformation of public participation in science. His new book, “Collecting Experiments - Making Big Data Biology”, questions what knowledge is, how it is produced, to whom it belongs, and who can be credited for producing it. His first book, “La fabrique d’une nouvelle science: La biologie moléculaire à l’âge atomique, 1945-1964”, explores the emergence of molecular biology as new scientific discipline and professional identity in the atomic age. He has established and is leading an outreach lab, the Bioscope, at the University of Geneva."

  topic: Reproducible Science
  description: Prior her current position, Fatma was a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow at Berkeley Institute for Data Science and a fellow at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley. She is interested in how sensory information is encoded in the brain and uses machine-learning approaches to fit computational models to large-scale brain data. Her current work focuses on cross-modal language representation in the human brain. She did her Ph.D. in Dr. John-Dylan Haynes’s laboratory at Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, where she studied functional connectivity changes during conscious perception in humans. She got a bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Computer Science from the Technical University Munich. During her master’s work Dr. Deniz worked with Dr. Christof Koch at Caltech, where she studied visual saliency and automated text detection. As an advocate of reproducible research practices, she is the editor of the book titled “The Practice of Reproducible Research”. In addition, she works on improving Internet security applications using the knowledge gained from cognitive neuroscience and Mooney images (mooneyauth.org). Her work is at the intersection between computer science, human cognition, and neuroscience. She is a passionate coder, baker, and loves to play the cello.

  description: Maximilian is a mechanical engineer with specialization in medical technology / biomedical engineering with a research doctorate in physics. Being fascinated by the question of What is Life? he decided to dive into Biophysics to understand the physical aspects of the building blocks of life. To study these objects, he built microscopes and employed super-resolution microscopy techniques. During his research, he noticed the increasing demand for computational methods to gather meaningful data and was amazed to explore the state of the art of Machine Learning and the Open Source community. Having now found a great workhorse in Python he is eager to apply cutting-edge algorithms and statistical methods to bring meaningful insight into data and optimize technology. He is currently working at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in the group of Matthias Mann.
