  topic: "Employing Open Source: A case study"
  description: Maximilian is a mechanical engineer with specialization in medical technology / biomedical engineering with a research doctorate in physics. Being fascinated by the question of What is Life? he decided to dive into Biophysics to understand the physical aspects of the building blocks of life. To study these objects, he built microscopes and employed super-resolution microscopy techniques. During his research, he noticed the increasing demand for computational methods to gather meaningful data and was amazed to explore the state of the art of Machine Learning and the Open Source community. Having now found a great workhorse in Python he is eager to apply cutting-edge algorithms and statistical methods to bring meaningful insight into data and optimize technology. He is currently working at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in the group of Matthias Mann.

  topic: Reproducible Science
  description: Prior her current position, Fatma was a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow at Berkeley Institute for Data Science and a fellow at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley. She is interested in how sensory information is encoded in the brain and uses machine-learning approaches to fit computational models to large-scale brain data. Her current work focuses on cross-modal language representation in the human brain. She did her Ph.D. in Dr. John-Dylan Haynes’s laboratory at Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, where she studied functional connectivity changes during conscious perception in humans. She got a bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Computer Science from the Technical University Munich. During her master’s work Dr. Deniz worked with Dr. Christof Koch at Caltech, where she studied visual saliency and automated text detection. As an advocate of reproducible research practices, she is the editor of the book titled “The Practice of Reproducible Research”. In addition, she works on improving Internet security applications using the knowledge gained from cognitive neuroscience and Mooney images (mooneyauth.org). Her work is at the intersection between computer science, human cognition, and neuroscience. She is a passionate coder, baker, and loves to play the cello.

  description: Jon completed his award-winning PhD at Imperial College London where he researched evolutionary patterns in animals like dinosaurs and crocodiles. He was the Communications Director of ScienceOpen for 2 years, but has spent the last two years as an independent researcher. He is the founder of the Open Science MOOC, the digital publishing platform paleorXiv, and currently works as a PLOS Paleo Community Editor. He has spent much of his recent time challenging the business practices of the scholarly publishing industry, including working with Education International on a global campaign to democratise knowledge. He is also a Shuttleworth Flash grantee, and has also won an award for this work on peer review. As well as this, Jon was the lead author of the Foundations for Open Scholarship Strategy Development, is co-author for the Open Science Training Handbook, and is the Executive Editor for the OA journal Geoscience Communication. He has also written several kids books on dinosaurs.
