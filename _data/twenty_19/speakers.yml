  description: "Adrien is a software engineer and machine learning specialist. He has been working at Snips for the past 4 years where his recent focus has been on building the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component powering the Snips Voice Assistant Technology. Adrien is a Python and Rust enthusiast and strongly believes in open source software development. Most of his contributions at Snips in the field of NLU are open source and publicly available on Github. He is an engineer from Ecole Polytechnique, and holds a MSc in Probabilities from Université Pierre & Marie Curie in Paris."

# There are many good reasons to open source a library but the journey to open source may feel painful on various aspects. Open sourcing done right requires efforts on several fronts like packaging, testing, documentation or code clarity in general. However, it turns out that there is a lot to gain in the process as some of these efforts get converted into good practices. Making choices that incentivize people to use and contribute to your work will eventually benefit both the community and you as the maintainer.

  #abstract: A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Containers can be used to package entire scientific workflows, software and libraries, and even data. This means that you don’t have to ask your cluster admin to install anything for you - you can put it in a container and run or easily share your analysis with collaborators. Containers are particularly useful way for reproducing research which relies on software to be configured in a certain way, and/or which makes use of libraries that vary between (or don’t exist on) different systems. There are a number of different tools available for creating and working with containers, and this workshop will focus on Docker and Singularity.

Alongside his research, Stefano writes for preLights, a pre-print highlight service run by the Company of Biologists. Prelighters are early career researchers selecting and highlighting preprints of interest from the hundreds `that are published online every month. PreLights put the research into context, highlight the main points of relevance, and allow the preprint authors to provide additional information about the work they have published.
  #abstract: The recent appearance of preprint servers in the biological sciences has revolutionised the publishing landscape and the opportunities available to scientists wanting to disseminate their work. Indeed, the submission of a preprint bypasses the long delays associated with traditional journal publications, the exhorbitant costs associated with the process, the paywalls and embargoes imposed on the final product. Testifying of the success of such new publishing strategies is the exponential growth of the number of research papers uploaded every month to preprint-servers such as bioRxiv. Yet, how can scientists stay on top of such a rapidly accumulating new stream of literature? I will share my experience as a writer for preLights, an online platform driven by early career researchers in the biological sciences, highlighting preprints of interest, and bridging the gap between authors and their readership.

  topic: Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research
  description:
  #abstract: Getting insight from scientific data is not always a straightforward process. Data is often hard to find, archived in difficult to use formats, poorly structured and/or incomplete.  These issues create friction and make it difficult to use, publish and share data. The Frictionless Data initiative at Open Knowledge Foundation aims to reduce friction in working with data, with a goal to make it effortless to transport data among different tools and platforms for further analysis and with an emphasis on reproducible research. In this workshop, participants will learn about different sources of friction in working with scientific data and how to alleviate them using the open source Frictionless Data tools. This hands-on workshop is aimed for novices, but advanced programmers are also welcome.
