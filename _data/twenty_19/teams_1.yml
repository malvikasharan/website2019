  description: Luc Henry has perfected his research skills in Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom, between 2002 and 2014. Over his scientific career, he gradually got involved in communication and policy. As a journalist and advisor, he later focused on the impact of new technologies on society, in particular in the fields of biotechnology and health. In 2014, Luc founded the community laboratory ‘Hackuarium’ in order to provide a space where like-minded people can meet and learn biology by doing, independently of their education and occupation. He currently advises the president of EPFL on research policy issues. Luc earned a DPhil (PhD) in chemical biology from the University of Oxford in 2012.

  description: Stephan’s research focuses on developing new acquisition and signal processing methods for functional neuroimaging that allow the tracking and visualisation of distributed brain activity patterns in real-time, i.e. while someone is inside an MRI scanner, and applying this in clinical practice. Stephan is passionate about making research and scientific practice more transparent, rigorous and inclusive. He started the Open Science Community Eindhoven , which is part of a wide Dutch network of researchers and university employees that works on improving the way we do science, and he is the founder of OpenMR Benelux , a community working on wider adoption of open science principles in MRI research through talks, discussions, workshops and hackathons.
